        "\n",
        "Colley's method, as explained in section 2 of the paper, is a sophisticated system for ranking sports teams that goes beyond the simple calculation of winning percentages. It was developed by astrophysicist Wesley Colley. The method incorporates the Laplace's rule of succession as a foundational concept, adjusting the standard winning percentage formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea of Colley's method is to adjust the simple win-loss record of a team by considering the strength of its opponents. This is accomplished by solving a system of linear equations that interrelate the ratings of all teams. Essentially, each team's rating depends not only on its own performance but also on the performance of the teams they have played against.\n",
        "\n",
        "Colley's method starts by transforming the standard winning percentage into a modified formula, given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$r_i = \\frac{1 + w_i}{2 + t_i}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "where $r$ is the rating of team $i$, $w_i$ is the number of wins, and $t_i$ is the total number of games played by team $i$. This formula includes an initial assumption that each team has a 50% chance of winning each game at the beginning of the season.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interdependence of team ratings is a key feature of Colley's method. The formula for calculating a team's rating takes into account the ratings of the opponents it has faced. This system of equations is represented in matrix form (referred to as the Colley matrix), where the diagonal elements reflect the total number of games played by a team plus a constant, and the off-diagonal elements represent the games played between different teams. The system is then solved to find the ratings for each team."

        "\n",
        "Laplace's Rule of Succession is a principle in probability theory that provides a way to estimate the probability of a future event based on past occurrences. It's particularly useful in situations where you have observed outcomes but are uncertain about the probability of these outcomes repeating in the future. This rule is central to understanding how it applies to sports ranking, like in Colley's method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rule is based on the assumption that the probability of an event (like a sports team winning a match) is not known but is estimated based on past occurrences. The formula for the Rule of Succession is expressed as $\\frac{k+2}{n+2}$, where $k$ is the number of observed successes (wins, in the context of sports), and $n$ is the total number of trials (or games played).\n",
        "\n",
        "In a sports ranking context, this principle is used to adjust a team's win-loss record by considering the likelihood of future wins based on past performance. It starts with a prior belief that every outcome is equally likely, and then updates this belief based on observed outcomes (wins and losses). The strength of this approach lies in its ability to handle uncertainty and provide a more nuanced ranking that reflects not just the number of wins but the probability of winning future games based on past performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The application of Laplace's Rule of Succession in sports ranking, like in Colley's method, takes into account the strength of the opponents and the team's past performance to predict future outcomes. This approach is more sophisticated than simply counting wins and losses, as it provides a probabilistic assessment of a team's strength, factoring in both their performance and the performance of their opponents.\n",
        "\n",
        "This understanding of Laplace's Rule of Succession and its application in sports ranking is derived from a combination of mathematical details and theoretical explanations found on Wikipedia and Jonathan Weisberg's discussion on the subject.\n",

        "## Massey Method\n",
        "\n",
        "The Massey Method is a sophisticated ranking system used for sports teams, particularly in contexts like the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. This method is distinct from simpler approaches like winning percentage calculations, as it incorporates the margin of victory in games, offering a more nuanced understanding of a team's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fundamental Principle: The foundational concept of the Massey Method is the assumption of transitivity, albeit approximately. Transitivity in this context means if Team A beats Team B by a certain margin, and Team B beats Team C by another margin, one might expect Team A to beat Team C by a combined margin of these two games. However, sports outcomes are rarely perfectly transitive, but assuming approximate transitivity allows for a more sophisticated ranking of teams.\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculation Method: The core of the Massey Method involves setting up a system of linear equations based on the margins of victory in games. For instance, if Team A beats Team B by 10 points, and Team B beats Team C by 5 points, these outcomes are translated into linear equations reflecting the differences in team ratings. The actual ratings for teams are computed so that they best fit all game outcomes in the least squares sense - meaning, the system attempts to minimize the total squared difference between the predicted and actual game margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementation: In practice, the number of games (equations) typically exceeds the number of teams (variables), resulting in an overdetermined system that does not have a unique solution. To resolve this, the Massey Method employs a least-squares approximation. This is done by transforming the original system into a new system, where the objective is to minimize the residual error (the difference between the observed game margins and those predicted by the ratings). This is achieved through a matrix operation where the matrix of game differences is transposed and multiplied by itself, and then solved against a vector of game margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adaptability: An interesting aspect of the Massey Method is its flexibility to include game scores in the ratings, which is not taken into account in methods like the Colley Method. This inclusion of game scores allows for a more dynamic and potentially accurate representation of a team's strength as it reflects not just whether a team wins or loses, but also how decisively they do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "Application: In practical applications like predicting the outcomes of the NCAA tournament, the Massey ratings can be quite insightful. By considering the margin of victory, the ratings can capture aspects of a team's performance that might be missed by methods focusing solely on win-loss records. This makes the Massey Method a valuable tool in sports analytics, particularly in contexts where the strength of a victory is as telling as the victory itself."

        "\n",
        "The method of least squares is a statistical approach used to determine the best-fitting line or curve for a set of data points. This is achieved by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets or residuals, which are the differences between the observed data points and the values predicted by the model. In essence, it seeks to minimize the discrepancies between the actual data and the model's predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The least squares method is particularly useful in regression analysis, a statistical process used to understand the relationship between variables. This method is employed to estimate the true value of a quantity based on observations or measurements, especially when dealing with linear relationships. However, it can also be generalized for nonlinear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of sports ranking, such as in the Massey Method, the least squares approach is applied to rank teams by creating a system of linear equations based on the margins of victory in games. These equations reflect the differences in team ratings. The method aims to find team ratings that best fit all game outcomes in a least squares sense, which means minimizing the total squared difference between the predicted and actual game margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "The application of the least squares method in sports ranking involves setting up and solving a system of equations. The rankings are determined in such a way that they best represent the performance of the teams with respect to their game margins. This system is usually overdetermined (having more equations than unknowns), and the least squares method provides a way to find the best possible solution to this system by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the least squares method is crucial for deriving a sophisticated and accurate sports ranking system like the Massey Method. It allows for a nuanced analysis of team performances by considering not just the win-loss records, but also the margins of victory, providing a more comprehensive view of a team's strength.\n",

        "My code above offers a detailed analysis of current men's college football teams using initial, Colley, and Massey rating systems. By processing team data and game scores from the CSV files, it calculates initial ratings based on wins and losses. The code then applies the Colley Rating System, factoring in team wins, losses, and games played, and the Massey Rating System, which additionally considers point differences. Both systems provide a nuanced view of team performances, with the top 20 teams displayed according to each rating, allowing for a comparative evaluation of teams under these different methodologies. This approach offers a comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of team strengths and standings in the current season.\n",

My results are very similar to these sources but not 100% accurate. This could be from a number of reasons. The data that I have used might be from a different source, not as up-to-date (missing some games), or there could be variations in how their data is collected, processed, and updated.\n",
